# trafficsim

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of trafficsim is to simulate traffic levels on the network starting with OD data.

To set-up the project with {targets} we ran the following commands:

```{r}
library(targets)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
use_targets()
```

To visualise the project data processing stages run the following:

```{r visnet, eval=FALSE}
tar_visnetwork()
```

To re-run the code in this project, use the following command:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tar_make()
```

For debugging, it's useful to be able to load an object from the pipeline.
Do this with `tar_load()`.

```{r load}
tar_load(clean_traffic_data)
clean_traffic_data
```
